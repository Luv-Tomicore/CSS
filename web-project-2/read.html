            <p id="info">
              A treaty is a special agreement between groups of people or
              countries. These agreements help them get along better by deciding
              who gets to use certain land or resources. Everyone has to follow
              the rules they agree on in the treaty. It's like when you and your
              friends agree to play a game a certain way to keep it fun and fair
              for everyone!

              Now, the treaty helps the Anishinaabe people by allowing them to
              build schools for kids to learn in their communities. Supporting
              their jobs, institutions, and local businesses on reserves. Helps
              protect their land and let the people hunt and fish. Allowing them
              to make their own rules and decisions about their land.

        <!-- Second section: Information about Treaty Two -->
        <div id="box2">
          <section>
            <h1>What is Treaty 2?</h1>
            <p id="treat">
              This treaty was signed on August 21, 1871. The agreement was made
              between the Anishinaabe people and the Queen’s assistants. It was
              signed at the Manitoba House. The Anishinaabe are a collective of
              three distinct peoples: the Ojibwe, the Odawa, and the Potawatomi.
              They originated on the northeast coast of what is now Canada and
              the United States. In this treaty, both the Queen's helpers and
              the Anishinaabe people agreed on how they would share and use the
              land. The land was in southwestern Manitoba and a little bit in
              southeastern Saskatchewan. Treaty 2 is different from other
              treaties because it promised schools, tools, and animals for
              farming while keeping hunting and fishing rights. This treaty is
              so important because it helped the Anishinaabe people to keep some
              of their rights and continue using their land as they were before
              the people from Europe came to their land. It also made it
              possible for new settlers to move into the land peacefully. The
              treaty was made because the government wanted to allow settlers to
              move in, but they also wanted them to make peace with the owners
              of the land. They agreed to share and respect each other’s space,
              like when friends make a promise to share toys and play nicely
              together. Some things that were promised in the beginning weren’t
              written down, so a few years later, they added more promises.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h1>What was in the treaty?</h1>
            <p id="treat">
              The Anishinaabe people were promised small pieces of land for
              their families. A family of five would get 160 acres. They were
              told they could still hunt and fish on the lands they gave up.
              Each person was promised $3.00 every year, which was later raised
              to $5.00. Even though it wasn’t written in the treaty, they were
              promised farming tools, animals like cows and pigs, and even
              wagons to help them start farming. Schools would be built on the
              reserves to help with education. It was agreed that alcohol
              wouldn’t be allowed on the reserves.
